# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About the Program
Tic-tac-toe can be used as a fun way to spend the time with friends to play an easy game online. This code is intended to provide that entertainment. 
This project was written in python for AP Computer Science Principles Create Task. To run this code, download the file and run on any terminal.

## Instructions
The game will prompt you to enter both users' names and a coordinate with x and y values between zero and two on each turn. 
Following this, an updated board will print after each move. The program also runs a check after each update and will therefore print when there is a win, loss
or tie. Furthermore, the game will track how many previous games each user has won so long as the tournament is continued.
